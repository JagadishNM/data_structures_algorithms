// Here's a JavaScript solution to the problem described in the screenshots:

// javascript
// Copy code
function findLongestCommonSuffixPrefix(str1, str2) {
    let maxLength = Math.min(str1.length, str2.length);
    for (let i = maxLength; i > 0; i--) {
        if (str1.endsWith(str2.slice(0, i))) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

function bestFactorization(str1, str2) {
    // Check the overlap in both orders
    let overlap1 = findLongestCommonSuffixPrefix(str1, str2); // str1 + str2
    let overlap2 = findLongestCommonSuffixPrefix(str2, str1); // str2 + str1

    // Choose the order that maximizes the overlap
    if (overlap2 > overlap1) {
        return str2 + str1.slice(overlap2);
    } else {
        return str1 + str2.slice(overlap1);
    }
}

// Example usage
let str1 = "1234yyabc";
let str2 = "abcxxxx1234";
console.log(bestFactorization(str1, str2)); // Output: "abcxxxx1234yyabc"
// Explanation:
// Helper Function:

// findLongestCommonSuffixPrefix identifies the longest common substring where the end of one string matches the beginning of the other.
// Main Function:

// Calculate the maximum overlap for both concatenation orders (str1 + str2 and str2 + str1).
// Compare the overlap lengths and construct the concatenated string accordingly.
// Logic:

// If the overlap is equal, the function prioritizes str1 + str2 as instructed.
// This code ensures the result is optimized for the longest factorization and adheres to the stated rules.
